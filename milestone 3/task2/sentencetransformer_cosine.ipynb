have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death', 'For example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found

had been asked to think about immigration scored 0', '92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0', '96', 'Those asked to think about pain scored just 0', '19', 'There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study', 'Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students

This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great', 'They’re reliable, sure', 'They’ll buy a patient who’s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital', 'But they’re also bulky', 'Their epinephrine solution isn’t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high', 'They expire after about a year', 'And they’re not so user-friendly', 'Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs', 'The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608', 'Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life', 'But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate, said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law', 'EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug, Price said', 'Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen', 'And more are trying now that there’s such a spotlight on the product', 'But it’s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap', 'Here’s why: 1', 'Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025 Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago', 'It’s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s', 'But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust', 'The company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack', 'The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design', '(Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label', ') If you’re a parent, and your child’s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection — and don’t want to read the instructions in that moment, said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants', 'You just have to know how to use it', 'Allen’s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors', 'He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work', 'Those rules keep consumers safe', 'But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards — without infringing on Mylan’s patent', 'It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering, Allen said', 'It’s not rocket science', 'It’s purely the patent that stops us', '2', 'There’s no room for error when you’re treating anaphylaxis Chris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that’s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years', 'Windgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated', 'But that’s proving easier said than done', 'Stepanian said he’s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market', 'Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds', 'Stepanian agrees that it’s more complicated than it seems at first glance: It’s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector — and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product, he said', 'It’s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it — and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA, Stepanian added', 'At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one', 'One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card', 'But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren’t getting the correct dose every time', 'It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009', 'A representative from Kaleo said that it’s in the process of evaluating when and how to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market — but Sanofi is no longer involved', '3', 'It doesn’t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body — but it sure helps In the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it’s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine', 'We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far, MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said', 'MannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections', 'But it’s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they’re familiar with to an inhaler', 'Sales have been far below expectations', 'The same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict — which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis', '4', 'The regulatory process is slow and expensive A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen', 'It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product', 'The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this, Baum said', 'But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk', 'Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk', 'Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it’s finally going to go for it', 'We’re just focused on being that competition, he said', '5', 'The public hasn’t spoken (loud enough) Denise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors', 'She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy', 'But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines', 'It’s something that’s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I’ve looked at it closely — until I had to start paying all this money, Clark said', 'Granted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan’s pricing for years, and complaints about the device’s clunkiness are no secret', 'But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it', 'That means there’s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation', 'I guess Mylan’s motto is, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’ Clark said', 'They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?']\n",

Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps', 'I could see them looking down at their phones, said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency', 'We had traffic jams, people were honking', 'It was pretty harrowing', 'And so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor', 'Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow', 'He continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks', 'That made Connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret', 'Waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to users destinations', 'Heres what you need to know about the app', '(Jhaan ElkerThe Washington Post) [A warning left on

growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby Interstate 85', 'In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections', 'The apps didn’t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn’t have known about otherwise', 'Waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver', 'Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app’s cartoonish interface', 'When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow', 'In Portland, Ore', ', for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a greenway bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic', 'It worked', 'The apps reacted pretty quickly to that, said Jonathan Maus, publisher of

part on the programs', 'In the Los Angeles region, Waze’s biggest U', 'S', 'market, a City Council person representing Sherman Oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small

working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said', 'Traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow', 'They have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have

drivers in the middle about to come to blows', 'Soon after, Connor went rogue', 'He experimented with Waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports', 'It

It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes', 'It all started with European luxury designs By the 1980s, making curved cars wasnt an entirely novel idea — it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers', 'The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance', 'But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars', 'Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves', 'They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk', 'In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers — especially in Germany — explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design', 'In the 1960s and 70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors', 'One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963: This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports', 'And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers', 'Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market', 'Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era: Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the jelly mould), and the car did not sell well at first', 'Over time, though, buyers got used it — especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars', 'In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack — whod worked on the companys European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 — was most directly responsible for the shift to curves', 'His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines', 'The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus: It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time', 'The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future', 'The Taurus, writes Gartman, was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed', 'The strategy worked', 'The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company — and inspired a wave of copycat American cars', 'Automakers had to improve fuel economy Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics', 'Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them', 'This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed', 'Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time', 'Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturers passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27', '5 miles per gallon', 'While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements', 'One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering under the hood, aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m', 'p', 'g', 'increase for almost nothing, Gartman writes', 'Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers', 'Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus', 'They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy, says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history', 'Technology made it easier to produce curves A few key technological developments made these designs possible — and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier', 'For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials', 'During the 1980s, they began using computer models', 'Its much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood, Sparke says', 'They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves', 'Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before', 'As a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier', 'You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB', 'Sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback', 'But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the 80s — and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus', 'Verge Video: This is the driverless future Mercedes Benz thinks well have in the year 2030']\n",

May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip', 'But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken', 'Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy', 'Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates', 'Number of the week Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths', 'A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53', '2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52', '7 percent last year and 50', '7 percent in 2013', 'The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too', 'Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers']\n",

a significant number of Latino voters, we’ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon—one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination', 'You may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were bringing drugs and bringing crime, and that they were rapists, criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, some are good people', 'Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor', 'Behold, the Trump Latinos', 'According to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent', 'Trump got an astounding 44 percent', 'I can only think of two people who don’t seem surprised by Trump’s strong showing with Latinos', 'The first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics', 'In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened', 'Trump has a theory', 'He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers', 'The other person who saw this coming was me', 'Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of Latinos for Trump', 'That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates', 'Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don’t know much about Latinos', 'Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word', 'This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls', 'Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada', 'That’s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country', 'And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren’t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats', 'In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote', 'Still, all those caveats and conditions don’t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance', 'We need to unpack that', 'But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe', 'The 54 million Latinos in the United States—whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries—could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November', 'And many of those voters will be in three battleground states—Nevada, Colorado, and Florida', 'Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion’s share of those votes', 'It’s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party', 'No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority

have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context', 'I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system', 'The context is also important', 'Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks', 'My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured', 'Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward', 'Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public', 'He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice', 'I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison', 'I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars', 'The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure', 'I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing', 'Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct', 'I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol', 'Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence', 'It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity', 'By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction', 'The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions', 'In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong', 'When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war', 'When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone', 'He is young, but he is old enough to know better', 'As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon', 'On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape', 'It doesn’t make sense', 'The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error', 'The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative', 'The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class', 'The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship', 'If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me', 'The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication', 'It felt serious', 'That’s all I’m going to say', 'He is a lifetime sex registrant', 'That doesn’t expire', 'Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years', 'It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life', 'A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands', 'Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life', 'I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault', 'I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person', 'To conclude, I want to say thank you', 'To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me', 'Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention', 'Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me', 'Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet', 'I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story', 'That we are looking out for one another', 'To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget', 'And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you', 'On nights when you feel alone, I am with you', 'When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you', 'I fought everyday for you', 'So never stop fighting, I believe you', 'Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining', 'Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you', 'To girls everywhere, I am with you', 'Thank you']\n",

spouse whos been married before', 'In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said I do', 'Theres so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general, Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post', 'I was really curious to juxtapose that with whats going on with remarriage', 'Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960', 'But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others', 'Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry', 'There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston', 'For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, eligible to remarry has also risen', '(But its worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since', ') The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers', 'While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013', 'The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried, Livingston said', 'Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013', 'Its very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasnt soured on the institution of marriage completely, however', 'Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two', 'Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again', 'Age wasnt the only differentiating factor, though', 'When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again', 'There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position', 'A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it', 'In comparison, 43 percent of women said theyd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didnt want to ever marry again', 'Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle', 'Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do', 'Livingston said its quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts', 'Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife', 'This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples', 'If you consider that 39 percent of first-time newlyweds (and 21 percent of remarried couples) are within a year of each others ages, this age gap among remarried couples becomes particularly noteworthy', 'But dont make too many assumptions about newlyweds -- its a demographic thats still in flux', 'While todays divorce rate might make newlyweds of the 1960s cringe, that doesnt mean that todays society has lost faith in marriage', 'In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960', 'Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family', 'Maybe newlyweds dont look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late 60s, Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of todays newlywed couples involve at least one person whos been married before', 'But I think its very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing']\n",

their own identity — a new first name, regardless of whether they’ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun — and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips', 'For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a malefemale binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings', 'But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories', 'Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options — something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for custom alongside male and female, with some 50 options, including agender, androgyne, pangender and trans person, as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version', 'Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of

built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like ze and xe, and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary', 'Certainly, there’s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn’t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian’s two-spirits or India’s hijras', 'But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don’t even realize it’s there', 'It’s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary,

social expectations about dress and behavior', 'Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O', 'K', 'with, even happy about, having a feminine physique', 'Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress, said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings', 'In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties', 'It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont’s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the

Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person’s biological sex, and sex referring to a person’s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one’s romantic interests)', 'I don’t even know what it was I was trying to show, Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh', 'Gieselman’s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin', 'They were very confused, Gieselman said, and still are', 'Sara Miller, Gieselman’s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed', 'At the time, it irritated me to no end, said Ms', 'Miller, a social worker', 'I was like, ‘Really?

            "['Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium', 'But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic', 'Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said', 'Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones', 'Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward', 'Here, we explore this hotly contested issue', 'What the heck does organic mean anyway? Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms', 'Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didnt receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed', 'By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health, Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email', 'When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says 100 percent organic indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients', 'Organic, on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while made with organic ingredients is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients', 'There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels', 'Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an excuse to charge more', 'Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable', 'A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say theyre organic really are', 'Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not', 'A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce', 'A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and substantially higher levels of antioxidants', 'So, what does this mean for human health? According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues', 'In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled', 'Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsons to cancer and birth defects', 'The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health', 'In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency', 'We’re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis, said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports’ Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post', 'It’s not realistic to expect we wouldn’t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal', 'We just don’t know enough about the health effects', 'Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects', 'When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, theres also conflicting data', 'The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods', 'A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds', 'A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids', 'Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function, wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U', 'K', '’s Newcastle University', 'But getting enough in our diet is difficult', 'Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients', 'As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut', 'The Centers for Disease Control notes that [s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop', 'So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue', 'Other ways of measuring worth: When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health', 'But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too', 'When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability, she told HuffPost', 'Organics are about production values', 'Those values are important to me', 'According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health', 'But organic farming still isnt perfect', 'One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit', 'Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers', 'Theres also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure', 'Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation', 'Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large', 'Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods, he said', 'It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly', 'According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated', 'The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers', 'Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses, the nonprofit writes', 'Many organic farms are small operations, though big organic farms do exist as well', 'If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where youre often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce', 'Organic on a budget Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just buy organic to the extent you can, when you can', 'And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply): 1', 'Prioritize your purchases', 'It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food, advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post', 'She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible', 'Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics', 'This would be a good second choice, she said', 'Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice', 'The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure, said Lu', 'For produce, buy organic if youre planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable', 'Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue, said Gerszberg', 'The Environmental Working Groups Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen lists are helpful resources on this front', 'The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach)', 'The clean list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues', 'These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower', '2', 'Buy in season (and local, if possible)', 'Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet', 'In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce', 'Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative', 'The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor, writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont', 'Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities', 'Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient', 'It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation', 'Its estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture', 'In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less', '3', 'Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too', 'Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sams Club and BJs sell organic foodstuffs in bulk', 'Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products', '4', 'Keep an eye out for sales and coupons', 'Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals', '5', 'Grow your own food', 'It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isnt as difficult as it sounds', 'It just requires a bit of effort and patience', 'Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden', 'Live in a small apartment?

Depending on your priorities, it might be', 'Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key']\n",

have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals', 'As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article Small Wins, we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make', 'By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective', 'Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions: The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety', 'By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal', 'The Dangers of Dreaming Big We are encouraged on a daily basis to dream big and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things', 'This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived', 'There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal', 'For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals', 'If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear: Our sense of self-worth can be worsened We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can’t be achieved The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health', 'By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more', 'Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health', 'Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins: Step 1: Start small First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it', 'It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done', 'Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day’s challenges only', 'Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward', 'This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem', 'Step 2: Reflect often Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress', 'So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place', 'This means comparing yourself — with yourself', 'For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones', 'By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions', 'Step 3: Reward yourself From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement — reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation', 'Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize', 'If the reward doesn’t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile', 'So, next time when you catch yourself single-mindedly chasing a complex goal without appreciating the small wins, give yourself a break and treat yourself to a movie, favorite sweet, or a short trip with your friends', 'Step 4: Enjoy the process Maybe the most important element to keep in mind in order to maintain mental strength in a competitive and goal-oriented world is to remind yourself to be content with yourself and the goals achieved', 'Remember to have fun and not take yourself too seriously', 'Enjoy experimenting and growing', 'By appreciating the process and the lessons learned, you will be able to avoid the stress and negative emotions, even if you don’t achieve

check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration', 'Another way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair', 'Again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth', 'Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer', 'Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you’re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet', 'Then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity', 'because, it might not be', 'Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can’t get it bigger than that, says Fisch', 'However, a lot of men don’t meet their potential', 'That’s usually because they’re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease', 'So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy — especially your cardiovascular system', 'What’s good for the heart is good for the penis, says Fisch', 'And OK, yes, there are some pills you can take', 'Obviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common', 'While they won’t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis', 'So if you’re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length', 'Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription', 'Supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow — both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch', 'Its worth noting here that if youre having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just arent what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease', 'Definitely talk to your doctor if youre experiencing problems like this', 'Dont just borrow a few pills from your friends Viagra Rx', 'ALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn’t worry so much about your size anyway', 'Seriously', 'First of all, if youre feeling ill-equipped after watching porn — stop comparing your goods to a porn stars', 'The average erect penis is 5', '4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch', 'Chances are, youre actually pretty close to average', 'And if youre worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyones preferences are different', 'Many women dont even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people dont care very much about size or length', 'The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partners ability to experience pleasure', 'Now, let’s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis', 'Sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference', 'But you’ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don’t care either way', 'It’s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner — and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on', 'Its 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all)', 'Bottom line: You cant magically grow a bigger penis', 'and thats OK', 'Yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis thats physically possible for you', 'But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who youre sexually compatible with']\n",

Yes, definitely', 'The apostle Peter says Christians are exiles on this earth (1 Peter 1:1)', 'Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon: Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare (Jeremiah 29:7)', 'By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will seek the welfare of the United States', 'Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation? If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win', 'Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency? Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives', 'But this can change', 'This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions', 'I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right

this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote', 'But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing', 'The prophet

gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them', '(Obadiah 1:11)', 'I am writing this article because I doubt that many I can’t vote for Trump Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be', 'In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency', 'The Supreme Court with Clinton as president Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan', 'This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them', 'But that is not all', 'Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent', 'Justice Kennedy is 80', 'Justice Breyer is 78', 'A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years', 'She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided', 'Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph', 'The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree', 'And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them', 'That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton', 'It is about

nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another', 'Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court', 'Abortion On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v', 'Carhart, 2007)', 'In addition, the court could find an absolute right to abortion in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions', 'Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions', 'Think of the power of the Obergefell v', 'Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015', 'It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman', 'But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile', 'The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States', 'We lost – not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage', 'So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion', 'Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional', 'The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated', 'Millions of unborn children would continue to die', 'Religious liberty The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views', 'So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct', 'Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations', 'Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections', 'Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible’s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics', 'His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs', 'In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda', 'MozillaFirefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman', 'This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda', 'Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity', 'Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim?

Some Christians have even hinted to me that persecution would be good for us', 'But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it', 'We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil (Matthew 6:13)', 'Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life: I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way', '(1Timothy 2:1) Christian schools and colleges A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education', 'Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of discrimination if they required adherence to the Bible’s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs', 'Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v', 'Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco', 'And now California’s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student’s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender', 'Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations', 'With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools', 'A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v', 'Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court', 'Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator', 'Churches Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court', 'The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general', '(This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools', ') And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their gender identity if the churches are going to be open to the public at all', 'Freedom of speech Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square', 'In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed in Jesus’ name when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v', 'Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court', 'Criminalizing dissent Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent', 'We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists’ claims about the danger of man-made global warming', 'But my conscience won’t let me vote for Donald Trump, some have told me', 'But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency', 'A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things', 'In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump', 'The Supreme Court with Trump as president Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court', 'A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a dream list of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench', 'Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the original meaning view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death', 'If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court', 'The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good', 'Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench', 'Abortion Such a court would likely overturn Roe v', 'Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states', 'Religious liberty A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches', 'Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v', 'Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion (note: not a specific denomination but religion in general)', 'A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination', 'Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies', 'It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time', 'It wouldn’t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them', 'It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended', 'It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies', 'It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states', 'Freedom for Christian influence in politics Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status', 'This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech', 'In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians', 'It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as family policy councils in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty', 'How can we know that Trump won’t change his mind? But Trump has changed his mind in the past, a politically-minded friend said to me', 'How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he’ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice', 'My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results', 'In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said', 'In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election', 'In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do', 'That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote', 'And notice how Trump has changed his mind', 'He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president', 'Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work', 'We should applaud these changes', 'His choice of Indiana Gov', 'Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative', 'Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard', 'Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress', 'He is a committed evangelical Christian', 'He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana', 'However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election', 'While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation', 'Taxes and jobs Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them', 'Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%', 'Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels', 'For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it’s 45%', 'Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump’s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs', 'Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth', 'In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama’s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most', 'Many can’t even find jobs, and others can’t find full-time jobs', 'Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year', 'It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers', 'Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control', 'Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom', 'Minorities Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs', 'Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention', 'He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs', 'And he said: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed', 'This administration has failed America’s inner cities', 'It’s failed them on education', 'It’s failed and on jobs', 'It’s failed them on crime', 'Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?', 'We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice', 'By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers’ unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth', 'The military Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding', 'This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS', 'Borders Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers', 'Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters', 'ISIS and terrorism Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS', 'Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive', 'China and Russia Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton’s support when she was secretary of state', 'If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won’t be bullied', 'Israel Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration’s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel', 'Energy Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs', 'Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all', 'Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket', 'Executive orders and bathrooms Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans', 'But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies', 'Health care Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation’s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced Cadillac insurance plans', 'But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry', 'The unprotected Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls the unprotected in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank', 'Trump said in his acceptance speech, Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned', 'I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves', 'These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done', 'They realize that Trump didn’t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock', 'They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say Merry Christmas, or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists', 'They’re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation', 'That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech', 'They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands', 'Does character matter? But are you saying that character doesn’t matter? someone might ask', 'I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump’s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent’s character', 'In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call reductionism – the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered', 'In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency', 'To my friends who tell me they won’t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won’t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen', 'Consider instead the most likely results', 'The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation', 'But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton’s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation’s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies', 'And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny', 'When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America']\n",

Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single', 'Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center', 'Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning', 'Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for', 'David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted', 'But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run', 'I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game', 'Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series', 'If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60', 'In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans', 'Bottom of 1st: Indians Can’t Match Cubs’ Start The Indians were not able to match the Cubs’ strong start to the game', 'Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks’s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out', 'Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three', 'Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely', 'Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning', 'Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 13 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks', 'But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs', 'David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs', 'He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage', 'He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses', 'My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night, he said', 'Too much info? Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches', 'Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop', 'Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort', 'Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop', 'David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls', 'Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1', '87 earned run average, including postseason games', 'But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days', 'Now it’s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even', 'Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it', 'Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop', 'With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first', 'The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play', 'Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks’ ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first', 'Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis’s speed', 'David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first', 'But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught', 'That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall’s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out', 'The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs’ batters getting warmed up in this weather', 'Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning', 'Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right', 'With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield', 'But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning', 'Victor Mather: Maybe you aren’t a baseball fan', 'Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2', 'As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron', 'David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee', 'The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench', 'Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single', 'It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners', 'Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double', 'Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third', 'Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game', 'With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop', 'Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play', 'The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out', 'But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat', 'Victor Mather: It’s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs', 'It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned', 'Baez never had it', 'David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up', 'It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run', 'Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even', 'Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him', 'The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky', 'Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead', 'Willson Contreras tacked on an R', 'B', 'I', 'double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game', 'Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left', 'Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs', 'He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second', 'Rizzo slid in under Lindor’s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor’s foot may not have been on the bag', 'That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center', 'Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez', 'Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis’s head', 'Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily', 'Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop', 'David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues', 'The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero', 'The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders', 'Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs’ worst Series performer', 'But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead', 'His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs’ fine year; now he adds a big World Series R', 'B', 'I', 'Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base', 'He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning', 'Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning', 'David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks', 'One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores', 'Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians', 'The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly', 'Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability', 'The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5', 'Still a ways to go, though', 'The meat of the Indians’ order comes up at least two more times', 'Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber’s Night The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller', 'Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber’s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace’s night', 'Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians’ bullpen', 'Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single', 'But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play', 'Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller', 'He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller’s unhittable slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right', 'Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw', 'It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning', 'Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches', 'David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845)', 'Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians’ pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup', 'Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber', 'They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard', 'Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over', 'The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes', 'No game in the series lasted more than 2:10', 'Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross', 'Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago’s lead in half', 'Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago’s bullpen', 'He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two', 'But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis', 'Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo’s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs', 'Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross’s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored', 'Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting', 'Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on', 'David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs’ Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment', 'Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch', 'He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air', 'Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask', 'It feels like a game again', 'Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago’s lead back to 6-3', 'Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning', 'Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs', 'David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up', 'David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run', 'It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score', 'Is it meant to be? Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning', 'That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell’s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on', 'Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first', 'Victor Mather: Oct', '14, 1908', 'Bennett Park, Detroit', 'Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series', 'They are nine outs away from doing it again', 'Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning', 'That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left', 'But with that that, Miller’s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team’s closer, Cody Allen', 'Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play', 'While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards', 'He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs', 'Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat', 'Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester', 'The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound', 'Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning', 'Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning', 'Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen’s stuff before eventually grounding out to first', 'Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning', 'Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs', 'Bottom of 8th: Tie Game! A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago’s three-run lead in just two batters', 'Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn’t quite handle', 'Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100', '3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left–center for a double, bringing in a run', 'Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt', 'Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning', 'Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity', 'Top of 9th: Cubs’ Squeeze Doesn’t Work With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches', 'The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base', 'Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes', 'Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt', 'That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs’ better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first', 'The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth', 'Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th This game is headed to extra innings', 'Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth', 'He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis', 'He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97', '4-mph fastball', 'Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning',

to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks', 'After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw', 'The Cubs’ designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game', 'Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second', 'With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist', 'The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs', 'Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago’s eighth run of the game', 'Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage', 'The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game', 'Bottom of 10th: Indians Get a Run, but Needed Two With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908', 'The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings', 'With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr', ', a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out', 'The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball', 'He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out', 'That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches', 'With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound', 'Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run', 'Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up', 'The left-hander took care of

Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program', 'Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service', 'Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world', 'Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians', 'The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families', 'Visions of AmericaGetty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline', 'Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville', 'So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that', 'The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U', 'S', 'Army, but it does not take a dime from the government', 'It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations', 'And it has already racked up some impressive numbers', 'Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already', 'And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017', 'Filling A Void The transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col', 'Walter Herd, the director of the Army’s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world', 'The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a résumé and job preparation', 'Connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army’s work', 'Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers needs and answer questions', 'They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site', 'Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program', 'It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster', 'com', 'In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of regional veteran connectors -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs', 'The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues', 'I’m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community', 'Retired Col', 'Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program Herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox', 'The Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get ‘em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation, Herd said', 'The preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece', 'I’m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community', 'The feeling is mutual', 'For Kentucky’s business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking', 'As economic developers, workforce is

successful recovery from the Great Recession', 'Unemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11', '9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today', 'That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today', 'Daniel Marans Retired Col', 'Walter Herd is director of the Armys Transition Assistance Program', 'The Federal Reserve Bank of St', 'Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy', 'The

health insurance giant Humana', 'And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker’s Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell', 'Army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region’s businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist', 'For one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place', 'Soldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science', 'But more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the attributes that service instills, Herd said', 'Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox’s walls to return to the civilian world', 'And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators', 'The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble, Herd said', 'So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society', 'The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they’re healthy, they stay out of trouble', 'Retired Col', 'Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program The Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative Pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army’s training center in California', 'There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas', 'It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation', 'What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn’t happen somewhere else, Pickett said', 'To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community', 'If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn’t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS? I wish every American could go through there, Pickett said', 'I was just inspired by it', 'Daniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox', 'Translating Army-Speak To Corporate-Speak Given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate', 'But unemployment among young, post-911 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers', 'In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-911 veterans was 7', '2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans', 'For post-911 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16', '2 percent, compared with 12', '5 percent among non-veterans of the same age', '(The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy', ') The reasons are complicated', 'The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers’ stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects', 'There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military’s separation from civilian society', 'The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world', 'As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today’s economy', 'Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world', 'The hard part comes in translating those skills from ArmyNavy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable', 'Kathy Robinson, founder, Turning Point Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work', 'Veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision', 'When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs, Robinson said', 'The hard part comes in translating those skills from ArmyNavy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable', 'In fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp', 'Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers', 'Fred Johnson Fred Johnson volunteers with Healing and the Arts to help younger veterans cope with PTSD', 'You Can Actually See The Community Change', 'Johnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life', 'Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army', 'Given Johnson’s worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description', 'That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox', 'They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville’s underprivileged schools', 'Johnson is now the organization’s director of workplace giving', 'I had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that, Johnson said', 'They helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process', 'I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense', 'Through his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville', 'He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it', 'I tell them, Follow your heart, not the money', 'You can actually see the community change', 'Fred Johnson, Army veteran and director of workplace giving, Fund for the Arts When we attacked that city it was like a wasteland, Johnson said', 'Then we helped rebuild the city', 'We are trying to do that here in Louisville', 'On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba', 'In addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds', 'Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work', 'The vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don’t do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority, Johnson added', 'The west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse', 'I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits', 'But Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan', 'I told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it, Johnson said', 'I said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative', 'She took a chance on me', 'I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage', 'And prove himself Johnson has', 'Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville’s top 20 veterans in business', 'Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way', 'He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing', 'The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD', 'I tell them, ‘Follow your heart, not the money, Johnson said', 'You can actually see the community change', 'Where Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career', 'He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it', 'A lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they’ve learned, he observed', 'They are 21 years old -- I say, ‘No, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span', 'You just don’t realize how many tools you have', '’']\n",

            "['July 1, 2016 | Nick Bernabe (ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees', 'The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners', 'Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria', 'Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November', 'Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives’ enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be', 'Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger', 'People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it', 'After all, it was during her husband’s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States', 'But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq', 'She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U', 'S', 'and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi’s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia', 'And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen', 'The only accomplishments that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria', 'If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her impeccable track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East', 'Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked', 'In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the Shiite crescent – the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon', 'So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran', 'But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel’s intransigence', 'Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel’s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully', 'One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria', 'Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called friends of Syria group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey', 'The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as friends of Libya, which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to', 'But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further', 'In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost', 'Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia', 'Despite Clinton’s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions', 'After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop', 'At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East', 'They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support', 'Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure', 'This is of course neither new nor surprising', 'Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran’s number one enemy in the US political establishment', 'The cliché in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West', 'That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power', 'Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it', 'In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract', 'But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed dual containment policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box', 'Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed dialogue among civilizations as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations', 'Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000', 'But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian', 'The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not', 'After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran', 'All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council', 'As Secretary of State Mrs', 'Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed the toughest sanctions in history on Iran', 'The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians', 'Now that she is running for President again, Clinton’s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices', 'In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs', 'Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, I want the Iranians to know that if I’m the president, we will attack Iran', 'In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them (emphasis mine)', 'Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel', 'Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons', 'Even though Clinton’s most important accomplishment as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of humanitarian intervention, which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship', 'While the leaders of Iran’s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran’s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels', 'In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran', 'Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran', 'In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, I don’t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement', 'I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will', 'In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again, We have to send Iran an unequivocal message', 'There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran’s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them', 'They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations', 'They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary', '(emphasis added)', 'Clinton’s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran’s hardliners', 'By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States', 'In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors', 'For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do', 'So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles', 'The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it', 'Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs', 'Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran', 'During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders’ suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations', 'Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama’s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that’s been working for the United States', 'This is not surprising', 'Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran’s hardliners are no exception', 'Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran', 'But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly', 'For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies', 'Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq', 'Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria', 'There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh', 'In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it, Why is Mrs', 'Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons', 'One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American exceptionalism and always speaks about American global leadership, which only means world dominance', 'She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East', 'Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran', 'Clinton is an Israel firster', 'Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as safe for Israel as possible', 'Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions', 'To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March', 'When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October which enemy are you most proud of, Hillary Clinton included the Iranians among them', 'This was truly disturbing', 'Was she talking about 80 million Iranians? If she meant the Iranian government, why did she not say so? Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran’s hardliners? Apparently, Hillary Clinton considers all Iranians as the enemy, which is truly disturbing', 'Those who argue that we should vote for Clinton as the lesser of two evils in the upcoming presidential elections are truly misguided', 'Yes, for decades if not longer elections in the United State have been reduced to choosing between bad and worse', 'But, not this time', 'Hillary Clinton is simply as terrible as Donald Trump, if not worse', 'Expect new catastrophic wars in the Middle East, especially one with Iran, if she is elected', 'This article (Expect Hillary to Do This Almost Immediately If She Wins in November) by Muhammad Sahimi, originally appeared on AntiWar', 'com and was used with permission', 'Anti-Media Radio airs weeknights at 11pm Eastern8pm Pacific', 'If you spot a typo, email edits@theantimedia', 'org']\n",

To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that’s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it', 'Why Messaging Is Different Text messages—the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices—more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms', 'The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way', 'For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you', 'It doesn’t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email', 'Text messages also offer a better representation of a person’s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations', 'Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it', 'The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list', 'You don’t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time', 'Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it', 'In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information', 'The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away', 'As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list', 'This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication', 'To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful', 'Cost Center or Revenue Stream? Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path—or at least a dimly lit one—to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream', 'While it’s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising', 'By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data', 'By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data', 'For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more', 'This ongoing memory—coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices—positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content', 'Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger’s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale', 'This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites', 'This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors', 'As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user’s preferences', 'In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages', 'Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium', 'For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you like via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from', 'On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again', 'Editorial Experiments Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself', 'The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that’s already been created', 'Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories', 'Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts', 'While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that’s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a brand building initiative', 'Since the user can’t really interact with the message, at best this experiment’s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text', 'In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary', 'In this paradigm, a publication’s staff members chat amongst themselves—for instance, discussing a news event—and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion', 'The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber', 'Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script', 'The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case', 'As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases', 'But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts andor run the live chats', 'It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to', 'Chatbots While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can’t scale themselves to respond to every user’s question or comment', 'This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news', 'In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person', 'Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response', 'Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story', 'Forbesbot on Telegram CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel', 'Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e', 'g', ', Kasich) contained within that original bot message', 'Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories', 'In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist', 'The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued', 'The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven’t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions', 'This problem isn’t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, We’re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small, says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz', 'But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean? To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations', 'The current limitations of chatbots haven’t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots', 'The promise of true AI—an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale—is far too meaningful to give up on', 'That’s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions', 'AI-powered News Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend', 'This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa', 'It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you’d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were—or perhaps before you even knew you were', 'This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter’s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as stuck in', 'the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want', 'Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? While we don’t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it', 'What’s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on—broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)—is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; ‘designing’ a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface', 'Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have? Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots all of your features need to be reachable solely through words—so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial, explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack', 'This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services', 'For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request', 'While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice', 'When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience', 'It wouldn’t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed', 'These writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news', 'This type of shift—the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft—could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers', 'Journalists don’t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold', 'There are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences']\n",

A combination of the two factors weve already discussed: market glut and the internet', 'As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion', 'Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- local scarcity as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth', 'The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick', 'Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T', 'K', 'S', 'Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time', '6', 'Hummel Figurines Most people have heard the name Hummel before', 'One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years', 'Hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel', 'After GIs returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market', 'No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there', 'Over the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model', 'Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value', 'Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place', 'Like with Thomas Kinkades work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market', 'The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights', '5', 'Comic Books If flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper', 'The reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion', 'It is often, he said, about a shared cultural moment', 'Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse', 'Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation', 'A collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively', 'There is no greater evidence of that, Griffith said, than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media', 'The idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that todays audience were all comic book readers when they were younger', 'Unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane',

went out and purchased a very fine piece of Chippendales Furniture', ') 4', 'Commemorative Plates For some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge', 'Historians are still struggling to explain it', 'Nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the Statue of Liberty Centennial, the World Series and Norman Rockwells paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by QVC and late-night television', 'The trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with', 'Unlike collectibles like Hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and Norman Rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer', 'Although billed as a collectors item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with', 'Today, as the eBay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the Statute of Liberty Centennial Plate selling for $0', '99 and most Norman Rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece', '3', 'Baseball Cards Cards are another quintessential collectors item', 'Today much of the collectors world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, Magic the Gathering, can still command enormous value', '(A single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000', ') Baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint', 'Its not that baseball cards have no value', 'As long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards', 'Its that they have far less value than people assume', 'While rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless', 'The disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality', 'Those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch', 'well, maybe the price of lunch', 'The reason goes back to cultural moments', 'America simply doesnt have the love affair with its pastime that we once did', 'When baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that', 'Today, as interested has waned, so too has demand', 'Those cultural moments change very quickly, Griffith said', 'If you think back, it was a year or two ago, the Seth Rogan movie The Interview and all the brew-ha-ha about Sony Pictures not releasing it', 'That was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on eBay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars', 'Today, those posters will go for a few bucks', 'Baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an

escalated', 'Dixey had a front row seat for the Beanie Baby explosion', 'A brief fad, America practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late 90s', 'For many Millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars)', 'As Slates Mark Stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999: The Britannia bear wasnt just a toy, we explained it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade', 'Our father capitulated and bought us each a Britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collectors item', 'One month later, the company that developed Beanie Babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year', 'Today, the Britannia Beanie Baby sells for $10 on eBay', 'Entire books have been written on the Beanie Bubble, but suffice to say that unless youre sitting on one of the Princess Diana bears (priced on eBay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the Salvation Army', '1', 'Lunch Boxes On the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old Fraggle Rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and Gatorade might help send your kids to college', 'Now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just arent that valuable', 'I had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them, Dixey said', 'There were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money', 'Then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork, Dixey added', 'You go back to the old adage of supply and demand', 'All of a sudden theres a glut of them and it brings the price down', 'One of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations', 'Part of it is simple lack of research, but part, Griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking', 'I did a lot of time in the 70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell, he said', 'What was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to', 'Today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information']\n",

antigen that might ever exist', 'This would require billions of different antibodies', 'And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would

rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies', 'And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications', 'Perhaps most notably César Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens', 'He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies', 'He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time', 'In doing so he developed, together with Georges Köhler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine', 'The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense', 'Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests', 'They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis', 'In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013', 'In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question', 'Scientists are
